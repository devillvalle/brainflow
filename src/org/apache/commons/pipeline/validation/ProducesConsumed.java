/**
 * This marker annotation indicates that the {@link Stage} produces the same type
 * of object that is consumed (or any subtype thereof). This is used to allow
 * correct resolution of stage compatibility between different parts of a
 * pipeline when there are intervening generic pass-through stages such
 * as loggers, which can consume any type of object and produce the
 * same object unchanged.
 *
 * This annotation is used in lieu of the {@link Production} annotaion
 * and overrides it if both are present.
