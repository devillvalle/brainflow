The easiest way to load images in Brainflow is to first _mount_ a directory.  This will attach the root of a file directory to the File Manager too window docked on the left side of the main window. This directory structure can then be navigated for easy access to image files. Only files that can be loaded by Brainflow will be shown in File Manager tree.  

To mount a directory select go the the File menu and select the "Mount File System" menu item (Control M). This will open a directory chooser which will allow you to select the folder you would like to mount.  

Once a directory is mounted, it will show up in the File Manager window.  You can then click on the icon to the left of the directory name to see its contents. To view an image drag, select an file and drag it in to the Brainflow canvas. It will then be loaded and displayed in a new window.
